\Large
    Quiz: Functional Programming (Practice Problems)
}

\noindent
%\textbf{Note:}
\begin{note}
The format of this quiz will be the same as the previous quiz (4 problems, each worth 1 point).
1 of these problems will be taken from the material from topic 0,
and the other 3 problems will be on functional programming following the problems below.
\end{note}
\vspace{0.15in}

\begin{note}
    I will generate new problems from the problems below by: (1) changing the expressions in the lambda functions, (2) changing the values in the range function.
\end{note}
